MagmaBlock
===================

__Feature-rich server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition__

Introduction
-------------
MagmaBlock is a fork of **[Nukkit](https://github.com/Nukkit/Nukkit)** and most of the original code was written by **Nukkit Team**.<br>
Some of the extended functionality that MagmaBlock offers:

* Synapse Client support
* More stable than Nukkit
* TODO: Support for Minecraft PC

However, MagmaBlock still has a long way to go. We welcome contributions.
